# C++ Graph and Heap Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate various aspects of Heap data structure, including heap implementations.

## Heap Examples

### 1. MinHeap Implementation
- **File:** `min_heap.cpp`
- **Description:** This program showcases the implementation of a MinHeap data structure. A MinHeap is a binary heap where the parent node always has a smaller or equal value compared to its children. It includes operations for insertion, retrieval, and deletion of the minimum element from the heap.

### 2. MaxHeap Implementation
- **File:** `max_heap.cpp`
- **Description:** This program demonstrates the implementation of a MaxHeap data structure. A MaxHeap is a binary heap where the parent node always has a larger or equal value compared to its children. It includes operations for insertion, retrieval, and deletion of the maximum element from the heap.

Feel free to explore each example to understand how graph-related problems and heap data structures can be efficiently implemented and utilized in C++. These examples provide insights into graph algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies.
