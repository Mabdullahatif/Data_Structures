# C++ Graph Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate various aspects of graph theory and algorithms. Graphs are fundamental data structures used in a wide range of applications, and these examples showcase different approaches and techniques for working with graphs in C++.

Each code example in this repository addresses a specific graph-related problem or concept:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) on a Graph:** The code in `adjacency_list.cpp` demonstrates how to perform a Depth-First Search traversal on a graph represented using an adjacency list. It showcases the recursive approach to exploring connected vertices.

2. **Graph Traversal Using an Adjacency Matrix:** The code in `adjacency_matrix.cpp` illustrates a Depth-First Search traversal and a Breadth-First Search traversal on a graph represented using an adjacency matrix. It shows how to connect nodes and perform both DFS and BFS starting from a specified vertex.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Graph with Limited Flights:** The code in `visit_every_city.cpp` illustrates how to perform a Depth-First Search traversal on a directed graph. It finds paths that visit every city exactly once while considering a limited number of flights.

4. **Graph Traversal Using a Stack and Queue:** The code in `graph_traversal.cpp` demonstrates graph traversal algorithms
using both a stack (DFS) and a queue (BFS). It explores the nodes of a directed graph while managing flights between cities to visit all cities exactly once.

Feel free to explore each example to understand how graph-related problems can be solved efficiently in C++. These examples provide insights into graph algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies.
