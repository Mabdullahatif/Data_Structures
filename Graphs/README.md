# C++ Graph Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate various aspects of graph theory and algorithms. Graphs are fundamental data structures used in a wide range of applications, and these examples showcase different approaches and techniques for working with graphs in C++.

Each code example in this repository addresses a specific graph-related problem or concept:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) on a Graph:** The code in `visit_every_city.cpp` illustrates how to perform a depth-first traversal on a directed graph. It finds paths that visit every city exactly once while considering a limited number of flights.

2. **Graph Traversal Using a Stack:** The code in `graph_traversal.cpp` demonstrates a graph traversal algorithm using a stack. It explores the nodes of a directed graph while managing flights between cities to visit all cities exactly once.

Feel free to explore each example to understand how graph-related problems can be solved efficiently in C++. These examples provide insights into graph algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies.
