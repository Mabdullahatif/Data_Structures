# C++ Recursion Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate the concept of recursion. Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. These examples showcase various applications of recursion in solving different problems.

Each code example in this repository showcases a different aspect of recursion, including:

1. **isMember Function:** A program that uses recursion to search for an element in an array and returns its index if found.

2. **Sum of Digits:** A program that calculates the sum of digits of a number using recursive approach.

3. **Array Reversal:** A program that reverses an array using recursion.

4. **Merge Sort:** A program that implements the merge sort algorithm using recursion to sort an array.

5. **Comma Separation:** A program that adds commas to a given number using recursion for improved readability.

6. **Binary Combinations:** A program that generates all possible binary combinations of a given length using recursion.

Feel free to explore each example to understand how recursion can be utilized to solve a wide range of problems in a structured and elegant manner.
