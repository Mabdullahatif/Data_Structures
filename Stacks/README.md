# C++ Stack Implementation Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that showcase different implementations of the stack data structure. Stacks are fundamental data structures used for managing elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. These examples demonstrate how to implement stacks using various techniques, such as arrays and linked lists, to achieve different functionalities.

Each code example in this folder demonstrates a different aspect of stack implementation, including:

1. **Stack Using Array:** A program that implements a stack using an array. It provides basic stack operations like push, pop, and display.

2. **Stack Using Linked List:** A program that implements a stack using a singly linked list. It showcases push, pop, and display operations with dynamic memory allocation.

3. **Balanced Parentheses Check:** A program that utilizes a stack to check if parentheses in an expression are balanced or not.

Feel free to explore each example to understand the underlying concepts of stack data structures and their practical applications. These examples provide insights into different ways to handle data in a stack-like manner, allowing you to make informed decisions when choosing an implementation for your specific use case.

Happy coding!
