# C++ Template Examples

This repository contains a collection of C++ code examples that showcase the usage of templates. Templates are a powerful feature in C++ that allow for the creation of generic functions and classes, enabling code reusability and flexibility.

Each code example in this repository demonstrates a different aspect of template usage, including:

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** A program that performs basic arithmetic operations using template functions.

2. **Matrix Rotation:** A program that rotates elements of a matrix using a template class.

3. **Generic Swap Function:** A program showcasing a generic swap function that swaps variables of different types.

4. **Shape and Rectangle Template:** A program illustrating the use of templates with classes to create a generic Rectangle class.

5. **Student Data I/O:** A program that uses templates to define a Student class and perform file I/O operations.

Feel free to explore each example to learn more about how templates can enhance code flexibility and reusability.
