# C++ Linked List Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate the implementation of linked lists using various techniques. Linked lists are fundamental data structures that consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node. These examples showcase different types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

Each code example in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of linked list implementation, including insertion, deletion, display, and specialized operations like checking for palindromes. The examples cover both singly and doubly linked lists, offering a comprehensive understanding of different types of linked list structures and operations.

Here's an overview of the examples included in this repository:

1. **Singly Linked List:** A program that demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list. It covers insertion at the start and end, deletion, display, sorted insertion, and checking for palindromes.

2. **Doubly Linked List:** This example showcases the implementation of a doubly linked list. It covers insertion at the start and end, deletion, display, sorted insertion, and reversing the display.

3. **Circular Linked List:** This program illustrates the implementation of a circular linked list. It covers insertion at the start and end, deletion from the start and end, and display.

Feel free to explore each example to understand the concepts of linked lists and how different operations can be performed on them. These examples serve as a foundation for building more complex data structures and algorithms using linked lists.
