# C++ Queue Examples

This directory contains a collection of C++ code examples that demonstrate the implementation and usage of queues. Queues are a fundamental data structure used in computer science for managing data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

Each code example in this repository showcases different aspects of queue implementation, including:

1. **Simple Queue Implementation:** A program that provides a basic implementation of a queue using linked nodes. The `Queue` class defines operations like enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (removal) with the associated `Node` class representing the individual elements.

2. **Template Queue Implementation:** This example features a template-based queue class that supports different data types. The template parameterization allows you to create queues of integers, floats, characters, or any other type.

3. **Circular Queue Implementation:** Demonstrates a circular queue, where the rear and front of the queue are connected, providing more efficient memory utilization. This example includes operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is full or empty.

Feel free to explore each example to learn more about queue data structures and their implementations in C++. Queues are commonly used for tasks like managing processes in operating systems, implementing breadth-first search algorithms, and more.
