# C++ Hashing Examples

This folder contains a collection of C++ code examples that showcase the implementation and usage of Hasing.

## Hash Maps with Probing Strategies

### `Hash_HashMap_basic.cpp`

### `Hash_template.cpp`

### `Hashmap_template.cpp`

This above C++ code provides a template-based implementation of a Hash Map data structure with support for three different probing strategies:
1. Linear Probing (HashMap)
2. Quadratic Probing (QHashMap)
3. Double Hashing (DHashMap)

**Description:**
- The code includes classes for HashItem, HashMap, QHashMap, and DHashMap, each implementing different probing methods for collision resolution.
- It supports inserting, deleting, and retrieving key-value pairs.
- The code handles load factor-based resizing to ensure efficient use of memory.
- Sample usage involves creating instances of the hash map classes, populating data from a file, and performing operations on the data.

### `students.txt`

This text file contains sample student data used for populating the hash maps in `hashmap_template.cpp`.

Feel free to explore each example to understand how these data structures and algorithms can be applied in C++ for efficient problem-solving. These examples provide insights into key concepts and techniques related to Hashing.
